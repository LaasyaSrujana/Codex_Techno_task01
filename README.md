# Task 1: Iris Flower Classification 

This project is about building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on petal and sepal measurements.

 # Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn 
- Pandas & Matplotlib
- Gradio (for deployment)

 # Files Included:
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code
- `iris.zip`: Dataset file
- `iris_output`: Output screenshot of the working model
- `demo_video_link.txt`: Contains Google Drive link to demo video

 # Features:
- Data preprocessing & visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Interactive Gradio UI to classify Iris flowers

 # Video Demo:
The working Gradio model demo can be viewed (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RHNejvM1cxh86IjVKFDXnHj4poi_QlRx/view?usp=drive_link).
